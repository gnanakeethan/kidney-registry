// The code below was going to be deleted when updating resolvers. It has been copied here so you have
// one last chance to move it out of harms way if you want. There are two reasons this happens:
//  - When renaming or deleting a resolver the old code will be put in here. You can safely delete
//    it when you're done.
//  - You have helper methods in this file. Move them out to keep these resolver files clean.
